'''
This is a script intended to be used on a cluster. This should be used in
conjunction with create_stimuli.py and run_script.py, along with whatever
bash script is necessary to submit jobs.

This script in particular uses scripts from ODENetwork to create the network
we wish to run on, and saves it as a pickle. This network must be created
before running create_stimuli.py

All network settings must be specified here.
